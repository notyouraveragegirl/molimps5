			<p>
				According to https://www.interpol.int/en
				/Crimes/Cybercrime
				"‘Pure cybercrime’ refers to crimes against computers
				and information systems, where the aim is to gain
				unauthorized access to a device or deny access
				to a legitimate user."

				Apparently cyber crime currently has the fastest
				growing rate in the world where everything is
				automated and computerised. People keep personal
				information, financial information and even
				work-related information on the internet which
				makes them prey to cyber crime.

			<h2>FACTS AGAINST CYBER CRIME</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					• Increasing the already implemented security
					around the internet.
					<br>
					• Educating people about what the internet
					really is. Truth is most people just know that
					there is the internet and there is Google and
					Facebook but really do not know what those
					are used for. When someone knows the use and
					importance of something, they are less likely
					to misuse or abuse it.
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					• Delegating the power to fight cyber crime to the
					users of the internet. The government is not all
					over the internet all the time, the users are, so if
					they allow users to be the ones to find crime and
					report it, it will make it easier to fight it perhaps
					making an online emergency application which
					a person can use after being victimised or if they
					think they are being victimised, like an internet
					based 911. People will feel more secure surfing
					and have more trust upon the law.
					<br>
					• Educating about the crimes committed on the
					internet can help users avoid them by not doing
					them or by sensing them from afar if they are
					about to be done on them.
